# LITA-CLASS-DOCUMENTATION
## LITA offered me an admission on Data Analysis. We started with Excel, follow by SQL. My applied practicals are documented here.
## PROJECT TITLE: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Querying using Excel and SQL

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to clean and structure a raw data set using Excel for initial organization, perform data summarization and insights using pivot tables, and conduct advanced querying for analysis using SQL. The cleaned dataset, summarized in Excel using some excel functions including conditional functions; pivot tables and further analyzed with SQL queries, provides insights into trends, patterns, and outliers. The project delivers actionable recommendations based on the analysis to assist in data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source
The data set was given by our tutors in persons of Mr Mushin and Mr Femi. Also, data was gotten from site such as kaggle

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
